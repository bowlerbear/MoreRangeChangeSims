### Simulation Study for occupancy models

This repo contains the code for simulations to explore occupancy model mis-fits in more detail.
The aim is to explore the consequences of different types of sampling behaviour (by citizen scientists) for occupancy-detection models. Specifically we aim to:
- assess the effect of different biases on occupancy estimates estimated by the standard occupancy-detection model (mostly along the Sparta formulation).
- develop diagnostic for assessing whether a given bias is likely present within a given dataset
- extend the occupancy-models to account for the bias
- identify additional pieces of metadata that are necessary to fully account for the bias in the model.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Define basic scenario set-up

```{r}

#Number of sites in the landscape
NSites <- 8

#Number of species in the regional pool
NSpecies <- 4

#Number of visits to each site within each year
NVisits <- 4

#Define average habitat quality of each site
ACovariate <- rnorm(NSites)

#Define average occupancy of species
OccProb <- 0.5

#Define average detection probability
DetProb <- 0.5

```

Simulate the occurences

```{r}

occ <- getOccuHistory(occProb = 0.5)

```


Simulate the detection process at repeat visits

```{r}

obs <- getRepeatVisits(nVisits=5, PrObs = DetProb)

```


Plot detection history

```{r}

plotHistory(obs)

```

Define parameters of interest regarding bias

```{r}




```



Simulate the data

```{r}


```


Plot the detection history at each site

```{r}

```
